              <p>Code First: Girls is a not for profit social enterprise, aiming to to increase the number of women in tech. I attended the Introduction to Web Development course, for 8 weeks in the Autumn term (with 100% attendance). Here I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript and, to conclude the lessons, I even made a website with one other girl (this website can be found by going on my github - Username: Pennyasf, Repositry: XploreWebsite). </p>

              <p>Raspberry Pi Club was a club that I attended thoughout First and Second Year of College (Lower and Upper sixth). This club was based around creating projects using a Raspberry Pi. Here there were also many differnt roles available, for example you could be coding, marketing, writing up work, or even building. In my first year I found that I did a bit of everything, and in my second year though I was the leader, though I still did a bit of everything, wherever help was needed. We participted, in both years, in a competition run by PA consulting, in the first year builiding a walking stick with voice recognition, GPS, and Ultrasound for the blind (we got to the final). In the second year we innovated an energy source that used both solar and wind to power a small battery with the idea it could be used in poor or remote areas to power something vital.</p>

              <p>At university I have also participated in Computer Science related activities. I went to a 1 hour taster with the MedTech society where I learnt how to programme a game of Hangman in Python. In addition to this I also attended an event run by the Computer Science society where I learnt how to code a basic game in Unity. Lastly throughout the year I have also been attending some talks and programming events run by the SAIS (AI society), which I have found very interesting.</p>

              <p>At College I played Basketball as I love to exercise and it's a good way to make friends at the same time. This year at University I played baseball which I found a new love for, I also tried gymnastics but I ended up breaking a bone so maybe its not for me... Outside of Universtity I also enjoy hiking and snowboarding as they are exhilarating, and the views you see are just breathtaking.</p>

I also trained and qualified to be a first aider through St Johns Ambulannce.</p>

In terms of languages I can speak English (I hope), Swiss German I am fluent, High german I am advanced, I speak a bit of French, and I also attended two give it a go seesions this year, one for Japanese, and one for Italian.</p>

             <p>Team work I have learned through a number of activities. To name one, in basketball it is very important yohu communicate with your team and also understand everyones strengths and weaknesses, as it makes more sense to give the ball to the best hooter if its the winning point. Similarly this concept also applied in the group project that I did this year in Biomedical Science, where we had to research, create, and give a presentation on an asigned topic. Biomedical Science this year has also helped me improve my time-keeping skills. I found that it was really important that I messed up with my time keeping skills within the first term, so that I knew what went wrong by the time second semester and exams came round. Time keeping was also very important in lab work this year as you get a practical that you must complete but only have 3 hours to do it, therefore the way in which you do things is vital.</p>

             <p>I have found that though I am very creative I am also analytical at the same time. For example in everyday life I alwayss like to notice the small patterns, or small iregularities that normally a person will not even realise exists. In my art I also like to think very analytically, in the sense of comparing body parts or facial features to other parts of the body in order to create the most lifelike and realistic drawing.</p>

            <p>Many things in life have helped me be motivated and resilient, for example a bad grade just motivates me to work harder until I achieve what I know I can. I also don't let myself just settle in the sense that if I know there is more I could be doing to achieve my goal, I will. Code first (the course mentioned earlier) also helped me learn more resilience this year. It did this because I learnt how frustrating it can be to have your creating (in my case a website) to not work evn after you are sure you have everything correct. I found the best solution is to go outside or watch a film, come back, explain your problem out loud and then you realise its something as small as a capital letter.</p>
